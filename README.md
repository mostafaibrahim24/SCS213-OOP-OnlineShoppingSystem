## Class "Seller"

### Class Attributes:

#### Private:

- [ ] name
- [ ] email
- [ ] items (dynamic array of objects of type **Item** with the size maxItems)
- [ ] maxItems

### Class Methods:

#### Public:

- [ ] Parameterized Constructor
- [ ] Destructor
- Operator Overloading
- [ ] << (stream insertion operator)
- _Add An Item_
- [ ] Takes an **Item** object as a parameter
- [ ] Function Body

  - (Use Operator == where an item is equal to another If They have the same name)
  - If the item exists Increase the item’s quantity by the quantity of the parameter item using the (+=) of **Item** class
  - And the price of the parameter object will be ignored
  - **Else :**
  - You will add it to the seller's items
  - **Return (boolean) :**
  - true if item addition was successful (If there is a place in the array)
  - false otherwise

- _Sell An Item_
- [ ] Takes item name and quantity as parameters
- [ ] If the parameter quantity <= item's quantity then decrease it from item using the (-=) of **Item** class
  - **Else :** (parameter quantity more than that of the item)
  - Print " There is only {item's quantity} left for this item "
  - **Return (boolean):**
  - true if the item was found
  - false otherwise
- _Print Items_
- [ ] Print all the item info for the seller (print each item using << of **Item** class)

- _Find an Item by ID_
- [ ] This returns an Item object (or a pointer to Item) with the specified ID if there is an item with such ID.

## Main Function

- [ ] Ask Seller to input his detalis (seller's info)
- [ ] Ask Seller for his store capacity (maxNumberOfItems)
- Menu To Choose from:
- [ ] 1. Print My info (print seller's info using << of **Seller** class)
- [ ] 2. Add an Item
- [ ] 3. Sell an Item
- [ ] 4. Print Items
- [ ] 5. Find an Item by ID
- [ ] 6. Exit

### Comments

- [ ] Author and Purpose of the Program
- [ ] For every function explaining what it does, Parameters it takes and return value
- [ ] Add comments to any part that is difficult to understand

### Coding Style

#### Naming:

- [ ] Names representing methods or functions are verbs and written in mixed case starting with lower case
- [ ] Private class variables should have underscore suffix. ex: int length\_
- [ ] Generic variables should have the same name as their type. ex: void setTopic(Topic\* topic)
- [ ] Non-generic variables have a role. These variables can often be named by combining role and type ex1: Point startingPoint, centerPoint; ex2: Name loginName;
- [ ] Variables with a large scope should have long names, variables with a small scope can have short names [1]
- [ ] The name of the object is implicit, and should be avoided in a method name ex: line.getLength(); NOT: line.getLineLength();
- [ ] Plural form should be used on names representing a collection of objects.
- [ ] The prefix is should be used for boolean variables and methods. ex: isSet, isVisible, isFinished, isFound, isOpen
- [ ] Negated boolean variable names must be avoided.
- [ ] Abbreviations in names should be avoided.
- [ ] Naming pointers specifically should be avoided. ex: Line* line; NOT: Line* pLine; NOT: Line\* linePtr;
- [ ] C++ pointers and references should have their reference symbol next to the type rather than to the name ex1: float* x; NOT: float *x; ex2: int& y; NOT: int &y;

#### Position

- [ ] Loop variables should be initialized immediately before the loop ex: isDone = false; while(){} NOT: bool isDone = false; while(){}
- [ ] Complex conditional expressions must be avoided. Introduce temporary boolean variables instead
- [ ] Executable statements in conditionals' conditions must be avoided.

#### Other Notes

- [ ] Floating point constants should always be written with decimal point and at least one decimal
- [ ] "0" should be used instead of "NULL". Note: NULL is part of the standard C library, but is made obsolete in C++.

#### Spaces

- [ ] Commas should be followed by a white space
- [ ] Operators should be surrounded by a space character.
- [ ] C++ reserved words/function's name should be followed by a white space
- [ ] Methods should be separated by three blank lines.
- [ ] Use alignment wherever it enhances readability.
